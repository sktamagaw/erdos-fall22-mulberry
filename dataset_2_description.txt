This document explains what each of the columns in clean_data_2.csv represent.

'ID'
From the original data set: 
A number 1 - 3000

'LIMIT_BAL'
From the original data set:
Amount of the given credit (NT dollar): it includes both the individual consumer credit and his/her family (supplementary) credit.

'SEX'
From the original data set:
Gender (1 = male; 2 = female).

'EDUCATION'
From the original data set:
Education (1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school; 4 = others).
I ADDED: the original data included 0, 5, and 6. Since the description didn't include those, I moved those to the 4 = others category.

'MARRIAGE'
From the original data set:
Marital status (1 = married; 2 = single; 3 = others).
I ADDED: The original data inlcuded 0.  Since the description didn't include those, I moved those to the 3 = others category

'AGE'
From the original data set:
Age (year).

'PAY_1' - 'PAY_6'
From the original data set:
History of past payment. We tracked the past monthly payment records (from April to September, 2005) as follows: 
PAY_1 = the repayment status in September, 2005; PAY_2 = the repayment status in August, 2005; . . .;
PAY_6 = the repayment status in April, 2005. 
The measurement scale for the repayment status is: 
-1 = pay duly; 1 = payment delay for one month; 2 = payment delay for two months; . . .; 8 = payment delay for eight months; 9 = payment delay for nine months and above.
NOTE: the data includes -2 and 0, and most values are 0.  
A cursory search makes me believe that 0 means paid duly and the negative numbers mean over/pre-paid, but I'm actually not sure.
Also, note that the lower numbers are more recent payments

'BILL_AMT1'-'BILL_AMT6'
From the original data set:
Amount of bill statement (NT dollar). 
BILL_AMT1= amount of bill statement in September, 2005; BILL_AMT2= amount of bill statement in August, 2005; . . .; 
BILL_AMT6= amount of bill statement in April, 2005.

'PAY_AMT1' - 'PAY_AMT6'
From the original data set:
Amount of previous payment (NT dollar).

PAY_AMT6= amount paid in April, 2005.
